title: API-less Web Apps and Fullstack Development

  For the majority of my time building web apps, the status quo has been a frontend talking 
  to a backend through some kind of custom web APIs. This might be coming to an end, and I'm 
  happy to see it go.

# TLDR,
Since we now have the tech to build SPAs without having to build web APIs, there'll be a lot
more web apps built without this. For web dev, I'm speculating the following changes:

1. Most web developers will be full-stack now
1. APIs will only make sense when there's a need for:
    1. Supporting multiple-clients (web, mobile, etc...)
    1. The API itself being a product
1. Some challenges:
    1. Security - without a standard around 

# Introduction
Single Page Apps (SPAs) have been the norm for a while now, and they are most commonly powered
by back-end APIs that allow them to read and write data without reloading entirely. While this
is not the only reason to build a server-side API, it is more often than not, the only reason 
why many of them exists.

Today we have have more options that allow the browser to call backend functions without having
to build a web API, at least I'm aware of:
  - [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io/)
  - [**Laraval Livewire**](https://laravel-livewire.com/)
  - **React Server Component** and **Server Actions in Next.js**

Of course underneath the hood, the browser still has to communicate with a backend over AJAX calls,
however we simply won't be hand-coding web APIs anywhere nearly as often. For web development
overall, there'll be some implications.

***Ackowledgement:** I am predominently a JS developer, so my opinion is strongly skewed by the
developments in JS land, particularly with React and Next.js. I recognize that this is still in
the bleeding edge, and if these tools do take over, it won't be tomorrow - I myself am continuing
to work on APIs that are built specifically for the browser to consume.*

## 1. Most devs will be full-stack now
Gone are the days when *"Front end developer"* were working on HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of JS for
novice interactivity. Since I got into the industry almost 10 years ago, the frontend has been 
ever growing in complexity.

Before Node.js, the skillset required to develop the frontend of a webapp and that of the backend 
system was significantly different. Although languages were by no means the only meaningful 
difference, it's a major barrier to entry for a frontend developer to get exposure to learn about
the backend, and vice versa. You can't really be efficient at gaining hands-on experience building 
an API without first learning Ruby, or PhP, etc... as a frontend dev.

More and more logic got pushed to the frontend, and over the years, we've seen the rise and fall
of countless state management libraries and data fetching systems that all tried to abstract
away the process of reading and writing data to the database from the browser (Redux, saga, thunk,
GraphQL, etc...). The dream was: if only the browser could call those backend functions directly,
then we can ship features without having to jump through all these hoops.

Of course, in practice, you would never be accessing the DB from the browser directly - for obvious
security reasons -, this dream is for the most part, here already. 

## 2. Web APIs will be less common
No we will still be building Web APIs (whether it be REST, GraphQL or RPC etc...), but they will
only make sense for specific situations.
